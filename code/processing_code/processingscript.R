# save data as RDS
# I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. 
# This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. 
# If you save as CSV, that information would get lost.
# See here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:

# location to save file
